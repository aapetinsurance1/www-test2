                            <br>In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute
                            between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any
                            provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity
                            for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by
                            final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act,
                            conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
                            Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the
                            parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
                            award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having
                            jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or
                            arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the
                            prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's
                            fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to
                            these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms
                            and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are
                            a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal
                            Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
                            The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
                            provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision
                            shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions. </br>

                            place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
                            class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE
                            THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL

                            COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE
                            ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and All
                            About Pet Insurance agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
                            than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                            representative or class proceeding. </br>
